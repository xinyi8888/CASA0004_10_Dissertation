Reminder on the conditions of use of safeguarded 2011 census flow data via the UKDS

Users of these data are reminded that these data can be used only for the purposes of not-for-profit research or teaching or personal educational development. The data may be shared with anyone who has registered with the UK Data Service and accepted the terms and conditions stipulated in the End User Licence. Results of analyses which aggregate geographies and/or categories of variable may be shared with anyone, so long as these results are appropriately protected not to identify individuals, households or organisations. Appropriate protection in this case has been deemed by the Data Owners to be the protection of any cell count lower than three. There is no requirement to round - though if users wish to do that, that is their choice. Users could suppress any counts lower than 3, or replace any 1s or 2s by a 0 or 3. These are not prescriptive; users may find other methods more satisfactory.
